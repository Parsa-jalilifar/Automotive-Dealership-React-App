# BTI425 Assignment 1

The purpose or objective of the assignment is to create a React app that interacts with a web API.
The web API will be posted to Heroku and Atlas, and provides the data for the React app.

The React app will use components to support the typical range of data service tasks (get, add, edit, delete). It will also be deployed to a public host (Heroku), so that you can deliver it to other devices (including, for example, your smartphone).
